Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John H. Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game in which an initially configured 2D grid of cells evolves according to the Game of Life ruleset.

Built using Python 3.5, this implementation of Conway's Game of Life allows the user to easily run the Game of Life using a 2D grid of choosen number of rows and columns in either a Linux or Windows terminal/console.
